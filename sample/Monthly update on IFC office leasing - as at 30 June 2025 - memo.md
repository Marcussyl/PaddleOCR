## Re:-Monthly Updates for One ifc and Two ifc – Office (June 2025)

The occupancy rates for June 2025 are 90.87% and 95.34% for One ifc and Two ifc respectively. The occupancy rate for prime office space in Central has experienced a slight decrease of 0.2% to 88.2% compared to that of last month.



The rental income received in June 2025 is HK$55.18 million for One ifc, representing a reduction of 10.73%year-on-year (YOY). The drop was mainly due to a refund of overpaid rents of HK$8.6 million for the lease restructure with CICC of 94,043 sq. ft. lettable in One ifc, which was recorded in the book of this month. For Two ifc, the rental income received in June 2025 is HK$100.19 million, representing a YOY increment of 1.62%.The Central office market showed modest but clearer signs of stabilization in June, amidst an environment of cautious tenant sentiment. While high vacancy and new supply continue to weigh on Hong Kong's broader office market, Central remains comparatively resilient— though momentum is still uneven.

Leasing activity saw a mild uptick, driven by fast-growing quant hedge funds expanding their footprint in premium Grade A buildings in Central. Additionally, several existing tenants also renewed leases with modest expansions, signaling cautious optimism amid a still-fragile macroeconomic environment. However, overall market rents remain soft, with landlords continuing to offer rental incentives to secure tenants. While Central is expected to outperform other submarkets due to its premium positioning and stronger tenant profile, rental recovery will likely remain gradual, constrained by competitive pressures and lingering economic headwinds.

We are currently in active discussions with several prospective tenants for sizable new lettings exceeding 10,000sq. ft. lettable at One and Two ifc, with anticipated lease commencements in Q4 2025. The available premises within the portfolio range in size from 1,288 sq.ft. to 19,768 sq.ft. lettable. Active marketing efforts are ongoing.Please find enclosed the rental details and highlights for June 2025.
